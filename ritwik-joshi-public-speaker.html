                                From Shy Kid to Storyteller: The Public Speaking Journey of Ritwik Joshi
                            </h1>

                            <p style="color:grey;">How a quiet kid who avoided the spotlight grew into a TEDx speaker, AI storyteller, and mentor to founders worldwide.</p>

                            <h2>The Unexpected Beginning</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;" class="excert">
                                If you met Ritwik Joshi in school, you probably wouldn’t have guessed he would one day stand on
                                global stages talking about Artificial Intelligence, startups, and the future of technology.
                                He was the sincere, introverted kid who preferred staying behind the scenes rather than grabbing
                                the mic.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Everything shifted when his mother nudged him to try something completely outside his comfort zone:
                                a district-level debate competition in a small village called Nadia. With no track record and
                                plenty of nerves, Ritwik stepped onto the stage — and walked away with <strong>first prize</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                That moment became the first spark. It wasn’t just a trophy; it was proof that his ideas could
                                move people when he found the courage to share them.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Sharpened on the Hackathon Circuit</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Long before TEDx and keynotes, Ritwik was pitching at hackathons across the country. Over the years,
                                he participated in more than <strong>100 hackathons</strong>, winning over 25 of them.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                These weren’t just coding marathons — they were speaking gyms. Every pitch meant explaining a
                                complex idea in minutes to judges from different backgrounds: technologists, business leaders,
                                investors, and domain experts. Ritwik learned how to:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li>Turn raw tech into simple, human language.</li>
                                <li>Tell a story, not just show a slide deck.</li>
                                <li>Handle tough questions without losing calm or clarity.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Those late-night pitches in crowded halls became the foundation for the confident, concise
                                storytelling he is known for today.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Speaking the Language of AI, Startups & Humans</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                As an entrepreneur and AI practitioner, Ritwik has always lived at the intersection of deep tech
                                and real-world impact. That’s exactly where his talks sit too.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Whether he’s on stage at a university, a corporate auditorium, or an international conference,
                                his speaking style blends:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — breaking down AI, automation, and robotics without jargon.</li>
                                <li><strong>Storytelling</strong> — using relatable stories instead of abstract buzzwords.</li>
                                <li><strong>Practicality</strong> — leaving the audience with concrete frameworks they can apply.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                This balance has made him a go-to speaker for sessions on:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li>The real impact of AI on jobs and businesses.</li>
                                <li>How early-stage founders should think about technology and automation.</li>
                                <li>Why storytelling is a non‑negotiable skill for modern leaders.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Milestones on Stage</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Over the past decade, Ritwik’s journey as a public speaker has taken him to some remarkable stages:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li><strong>TEDx Talks</strong> on the evolution of AI, robotics, and the human side of technology.</li>
                                <li><strong>IBM Developer Connect & IBM Code Day</strong>, where he decoded AI and automation for
                                    developers and enterprise teams.</li>
                                <li><strong>Microsoft Students Club Pilani</strong>, in an “Ask Me Anything” on AI and robotics:
                                    trap or guard?</li>
                                <li><strong>Startup forums and investor events</strong> at places like CIIE IIM Ahmedabad and Dubai Expo,
                                    where he pitched and mentored around innovation and product growth.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Every stage reinforced the same lesson: technology talks land best when they are designed
                                for hearts and minds, not just for slides and specs.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Speaking for Communities, Not Just Conferences</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Beyond formal conferences, Ritwik has been deeply involved with startup and speaking communities:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li>Hosting and moderating <strong>eChai Ventures</strong> startup meetups.</li>
                                <li>Sharing his journey and frameworks with early‑stage founders across India.</li>
                                <li>Spending nearly a decade with <strong>Toastmasters International</strong>, refining his craft as
                                    both a speaker and leader.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                These spaces keep him close to real founders, students, and professionals — the same people
                                he designs his talks for.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What Makes His Talks Different</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Organizers and attendees often describe Ritwik’s talks as:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li><strong>Human</strong> — even when the topic is advanced AI.</li>
                                <li><strong>Honest</strong> — no over‑hype, just real stories and lessons.</li>
                                <li><strong>Actionable</strong> — audiences walk away with ideas they can implement on Monday.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                He doesn’t just “talk about AI” — he connects it to careers, startups, product building,
                                and the emotional realities of change.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Why Audiences Connect with Ritwik</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                People don’t just remember the slides; they remember how a speaker made them feel.
                                Ritwik’s journey — from a shy kid who didn’t raise his hand in class to a TEDx speaker
                                addressing hundreds of people — is something many introverts, students, and young founders
                                quietly relate to.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                His message is simple but powerful: you don’t need to be born confident to become a strong
                                communicator. You just need:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li>One person who believes in you (like his mother did).</li>
                                <li>Spaces to practice — debates, hackathons, communities.</li>
                                <li>A story you genuinely care about telling.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Booking Ritwik as a Speaker</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Today, Ritwik works with universities, startup communities, and companies that want talks
                                which are both intellectually sharp and emotionally grounded.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                If you’re looking for a speaker who can:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li>Demystify AI and automation for non‑technical audiences,</li>
                                <li>Inspire students and early‑stage founders to think bigger,</li>
