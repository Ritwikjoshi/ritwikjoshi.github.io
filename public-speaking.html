								🤔 So, let me share a slice of my journey. Back in 7th grade, I was navigating the whole shyness thing, feeling a bit lost after not making the cut for the basketball and football teams. Enter my Mom, who saw this hidden speaker potential in me.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								💫 She tossed the idea of trying out the District Level Debate competition. Why not, I thought? So, I jumped in, did a ton of prep, and nervously spilled my thoughts in a small village called Nadia. Guess what? <strong>I snagged the 👑 1st prize.</strong> Unexpected, right?
							</p>
						</li>					
						<li>
							<p>
								✨ That win sparked something in me. Suddenly, I found myself on this journey of self-discovery and public speaking. And get this—I kept <strong>winning the District Level Debate competition for the next 👑 Three 👑 Years 👑 straight.</strong>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								This story? It's all about unexpected wins, the power of a mom's belief, and how even the shyest folks can find their voice and make a splash. Life's funny that way, isn't it? 🚀💬
