                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                In his TEDxYouth talk, <em>“The Story of the Emergence and Growth of AI”</em>, Ritwik Joshi doesn’t
                                talk about a distant, dystopian future. Instead, he walks the audience through a very real present
                                — where ideas once reserved for sci‑fi movies are now quietly shaping our everyday lives.

                            <h2>1. Moving Beyond the “Terminator” Myth</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;" class="excert">
                                Ritwik opens by addressing the most common narrative around AI — the one shaped by robots,
                                killer machines, and all‑knowing assistants from movies.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                He explains that most people subconsciously equate AI with characters like Terminator, Jarvis,
                                or humanoid robots with personalities. In reality, what we use in our daily lives is
                                <strong>Narrow AI</strong> — systems built to perform very specific tasks.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                On one end of the spectrum, there’s the simple program that opens an automatic door at a mall.
                                On the other, there are sophisticated algorithms that help dock rockets at space stations with
                                surgical precision. Somewhere far beyond that lies <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong> —
                                human‑level intelligence that can think and learn across domains. That’s the version people fear,
                                but it’s not the AI we interact with today.
                            </p>

                            <h2>2. When Science Fiction Becomes a User Manual</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                One of the most memorable parts of the talk is Ritwik’s claim that <strong>“almost 80% of what used to be
                                science fiction is now a roaring reality.”</strong> He proves this by drawing direct parallels between
                                iconic movie scenes and real‑world innovations:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li><strong>Elysium → HAL Exoskeleton</strong><br>
                                    What once looked like fantasy armor is now used in rehab centers as the
                                    <em>Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL)</em>, helping paralyzed patients stand and walk again.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>RoboCop → Robot Police</strong><br>
                                    In 2017, Dubai introduced autonomous robotic officers to support law enforcement — a striking
                                    echo of what cinema imagined decades ago.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Total Recall’s Johnny Cab → Self‑Driving Cars</strong><br>
                                    Companies like Tesla and Waymo now operate vehicles that can navigate roads without a human
                                    touching the steering wheel.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Iron Man’s Jarvis → Digital Assistants & Digital Humans</strong><br>
                                    Voice assistants, conversational AI, and lifelike digital humans are already handling support,
                                    sales, and onboarding for brands worldwide.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                The message is clear: what we once called “fiction” has quietly turned into engineering backlogs
                                and product roadmaps.
                            </p>

                            <h2>3. Bringing a Digital Human On Stage</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Rather than just talk about AI, Ritwik lets the audience experience it.
                                During the session, he introduces <strong>Pia</strong> — a digital assistant built using his company’s
                                conversational AI technology. At one point, Pia even “interrupts” the talk to introduce herself
                                and explain why she exists.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                He then showcases hyper‑realistic avatars from platforms like manav.ai, designed with details down
                                to the exact number of hairs on an eyebrow. These aren’t just lab demos; similar digital humans
                                are already guiding travelers at places like Bengaluru Airport, helping people with security and
                                boarding queries.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                For the audience, this was a shift from “AI on slides” to “AI in front of you.”
                            </p>

                            <h2>4. The Big Question: Will AI Take Our Jobs?</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                With tools like ChatGPT, image generators, and low‑code platforms gaining visibility, it’s natural
                                for content writers, designers, and young professionals to feel anxious.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                Ritwik doesn’t dismiss these fears, but he reframes them. He argues that AI is best at handling
                                work that is:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li>Repetitive</li>
                                <li>Rule‑based</li>
                                <li>Time‑consuming but low on creativity</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                That, he says, is exactly the kind of work humans shouldn’t be stuck doing forever. When machines
                                take over the repeatable tasks, people are freed up for higher‑order thinking — strategy, design,
                                storytelling, empathy, and leadership.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                His direct message to students in the audience:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote style="color:grey;">
                                Don’t just fear the tools. Learn how to build them. AI will shape the future of our country and
                                the world — and you can either be a passive user or an active creator.
                            </blockquote>

                            <h2>5. From “Scary Future” to “Empowered Present”</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                The real power of the talk lies in how it shifts the emotional framing of AI. Instead of painting
                                AI as an unstoppable villain or magical savior, Ritwik presents it as a <strong>tool that has been
                                quietly evolving alongside us for decades</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                When you zoom out, the story of AI is also a story of human curiosity:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="color:grey;">
                                <li>Curiosity that turned science fiction into research papers.</li>
                                <li>Research that turned into products and companies.</li>
                                <li>Products that now sit in our pockets, homes, cars, classrooms, and offices.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                The TEDx talk leaves the audience not with fear, but with responsibility — especially the younger
                                generation who will inherit and build the next wave of intelligent systems.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Final Takeaway</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey;">
                                If there is one line that captures the soul of the talk, it’s this:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote style="color:grey;">
                                “AI is not here to replace humans; it’s here to assist us… Together we can make the world a better place.”
                            </blockquote>

                                For students, founders, and professionals, Ritwik’s TEDxYouth session is both a reality check and
                                an invitation: understand the technology, respect its power, and then use it intentionally to
                                build something meaningful.
                            </p>
